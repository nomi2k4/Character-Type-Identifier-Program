Character Type Identifier Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program identifies the type of a character input by the user.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input a character
- Checks if the character is an alphabet using isalpha()
- If alphabet, checks if it's uppercase or lowercase using isupper()
- Converts the character to lowercase using tolower()
- Identifies the character as a vowel or consonant using a switch statement
- Displays the character type

Features:

- User input for character
- Conditional statements for character type identification
- Use of isalpha(), isupper(), and tolower() functions
- Switch statement for vowel/consonant identification
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./character_identifier
    - On Windows: character_identifier.exe
4. Enter a character when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using conditional statements for decision-making
- Working with character variables and functions (isalpha(), isupper(), tolower())
- Basic character type identification logic
